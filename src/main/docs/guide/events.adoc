Micronaut fires two different events when:

- The schema has been cleaned: link:{api}/io/micronaut/configuration/dbmigration/flyway/event/SchemaCleanedEvent.html[SchemaCleanedEvent].
- The migrations have been executed: link:{api}/io/micronaut/configuration/dbmigration/flyway/event/MigrationFinishedEvent.html[MigrationFinishedEvent].
